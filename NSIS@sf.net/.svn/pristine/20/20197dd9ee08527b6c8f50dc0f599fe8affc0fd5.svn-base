\S1{v2.0b4-rn} Release Notes

\b The /LANG parameter is no longer available for any text setting instructions. You must use a \R{langstring}{LangString} if you want to make a certain text multilingual.

\b \L{../Contrib/Modern UI/Readme.html}{Modern UI 1.67}: Because of the new syntax for pages, renaming of settings and variable names etc., you have to make some changes to your scripts, see the \L{../Contrib/Modern UI/Readme.html}{Modern UI Readme} for details.

\b \R{onselchange}{.onSelChange} is no longer called when the components page is created.

\b The icons folder has been renamed to Graphics and was reorganized. If you were using any files from Contrib\\Icons in your script, you should update it to point to the new image or icon path.
