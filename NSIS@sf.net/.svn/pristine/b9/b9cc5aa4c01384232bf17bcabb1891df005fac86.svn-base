\S2{ssection} Section

\c [/e] [section_name] [section index output]

Begins and opens a new section. If section_name is empty, omitted, or begins with a -, then it is a required section and the user will not see it, nor have the option of disabling it. If the section name is 'Uninstall', then it is a special Uninstall Section. If section index output is specified, the parameter will be !defined with the section index (that can be used for SectionSetText etc).

\S2{ssectionend} SectionEnd

This command closes the current open section.

\S2{ssectionin} SectionIn

\c insttype_index [insttype_index] [RO]

This command specifies which Install Types (see InstType) the current section defaults to the enabled state in. Multiple SectionIn commands can be specified (they are combined). If you specify RO as a parameter, then the section will be Read-Only, meaning it will always be set to install.

\S2{ssubsection} SubSection

\c [/e] Caption [section index output]

This command inserts a subsection. The subsection must be close with SubSectionEnd, and should contain 1 or more Sections. If the subsection name begins with a !, the subsection will be displayed as bold. If /e is present, the sub sections of the sub section will be expanded by default. If section index output is specified, the parameter will be !defined with the section index (that can be used for SectionSetText etc).

\S2{ssubsectionend} SubSectionEnd

Closes a subsection opened with SubSection.
