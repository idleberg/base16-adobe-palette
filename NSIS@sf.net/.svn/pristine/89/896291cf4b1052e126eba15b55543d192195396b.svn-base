\S1{installlog} Install Logging Instructions

\S2{logset} LogSet

\c on|off

Sets whether install logging to $INSTDIR\\install.log will happen. $INSTDIR must have a value before you call this function or it will not work. Note that \e{NSIS_CONFIG_LOG} must be set in the installer configuration (it is not by default) to support this.

\S2{logtext} LogText

\c text

If installer logging is enabled, inserts text "text" into the log file.
