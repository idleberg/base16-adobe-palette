\S2{sectionsetflags} SectionSetFlags

\c section_index section_flags

Sets the section's flags. The flag is a 32 bit integer. The first bit (lowest) represents whether the section is currently enabled, the second bit represents whether the section is a subsection (don't modify this unless you really know what you are doing), the third bit represents whether the section is a subsection end (again, don't modify), the fourth bit represents whether the section is shown in bold or not, the fifth bit represents whether the section is read-only and the sixth bit represents whether the sub-section is to be automatically expanded. The error flag will be set if an out of range section is specified.

For an example of usage please see the \W{../Examples/one-section.nsi}{one-section.nsi} example.

\S2{sectiongetflags} SectionGetFlags

\c section_index user_var(output)

Retrieves the section's flags. See above for a description of the flag. The error flag will be set if an out of range section is specified.

\S2{sectionsettext} SectionSetText

\c section_index section_text

Sets the description for the section section_index. To set a subsection, you must use - at the beginning of the text.  The error flag will be set if an out of range section is specified.

\S2{sectiongettext} SectionGetText

\c section_index user_var(output)

Stores the text description of the section section_index into the output. If the section is hidden, stores an empty string. The error flag will be set if an out of range section is specified.

\S2{SectionSetInstTypes} SectionSetInstTypes

\c section_index inst_types

Sets the install types the section section specified by section_index defaults to the enabled state in. Note that the section index starts with zero. Every bit of inst_types is a flag that tells if the section is in that install type or not. For example, if you have 3 install types and you want the first section to be included in install types 1 and 3, then the command should look like this:

\c SectionSetInstTypes 0 5

because the binary value for 5 is "00000101". The error flag will be set if the section index specified is out of range.

\S2{SectionGetInstTypes} SectionGetInstTypes

\c section_index user_var(output)

Retrieves the install types flags array of a section. See above explanation about SectionSetInstTypes for a description of how to deal with the output. The error flag will be set if the section index specified is out of range.
